## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **src/utils/colorMatrix.ts**

   - Added color matrix transformations for all 12 Instagram filters
   - Each filter uses a 5x4 color matrix for RGB transformations
   - Maintains compatibility with existing filter system

2. **src/types/index.ts**

   - Extended `ImageFilter` type to include all new filter types
   - Maintains type safety across the application

3. **src/screens/EditorScreen.tsx**
   - Added all 12 filters to the FILTERS array
   - Each filter has a unique ID, name, and color
   - Filters appear in the horizontal scrolling toolbar

## Usage

Users can apply filters by:

1. Opening an image in the editor
2. Tapping the "Filter" tool in the bottom toolbar
3. Scrolling through the horizontal filter list
4. Tapping any filter to apply it instantly
5. Tapping "Original" to remove the filter

## Color Matrix Approach

Each filter uses a 5x4 color transformation matrix:

- Rows 1-3: RGB channel transformations
- Row 4: Alpha channel (transparency)
- Column 5: Offset values for brightness adjustments

The matrices are carefully tuned to replicate Instagram's filter aesthetics while maintaining image quality during export.
