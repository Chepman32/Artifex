# üîç Image Loading Debug Test

## Changes Made for Testing

### 1. **Added Direct Image Test**

**File**: `src/screens/EditorScreen.tsx`

- Added a small 100x100 test image above the canvas
- Shows "Direct Image Test:" label
- Uses same iOS Photos URI as the canvas
- Has red background to see if image loads
- Console logs for load/error events

### 2. **Enhanced SkiaCanvas Debugging**

**File**: `src/components/SkiaCanvas.tsx`

- Added console logs for iOS Photo load success/error
- Fixed z-index layering (background: 1, overlay: 2)
- Added error handling for image loading

### 3. **What to Look For**

#### **Visual Test**

1. **Run the app**: `yarn ios`
2. **Select iOS photo** from gallery
3. **Look for**: Small test image above the canvas
4. **Expected**: Should see the photo in a 100x100 box

#### **Console Test**

Watch for these logs:

```
Direct image loaded!  ‚Üê Test image works
iOS Photo loaded successfully  ‚Üê Canvas image works
```

OR error logs:

```
Direct image error: {...}  ‚Üê Test image fails
iOS Photo load error: {...}  ‚Üê Canvas image fails
```

## Possible Outcomes & Next Steps

### **Scenario 1: Test Image Shows**

‚úÖ **iOS Photos URIs work** with React Native Image

- Issue is with canvas layering/positioning
- Fix: Adjust SkiaCanvas layout

### **Scenario 2: Test Image Doesn't Show**

‚ùå **iOS Photos URIs don't work** with React Native Image

- Issue is with URI format or permissions
- Fix: Need different approach (convert URI or use different library)

### **Scenario 3: Both Images Show**

üéâ **Everything works!**

- Issue was just z-index or positioning
- Fix: Remove test code, keep the working solution

### **Scenario 4: Console Shows Errors**

üîç **Specific error identified**

- Check error message for exact issue
- Fix: Address the specific error (permissions, format, etc.)

## Debug Commands

### **Check Console Logs**

```bash
# In your terminal running the app
# Look for these specific messages:
# - "Direct image loaded!"
# - "iOS Photo loaded successfully"
# - Any error messages
```

### **Visual Inspection**

- **Test image**: Should appear as small photo above canvas
- **Canvas**: Should show full-size photo
- **Background**: Red background visible if image fails to load

## Next Steps Based on Results

1. **Run the test** and observe results
2. **Report back** what you see:
   - Does the small test image show?
   - Does the canvas image show?
   - Any console errors?
3. **Based on results**, we'll apply the appropriate fix

This test will definitively show us whether iOS Photos URIs work with React Native Image components! üîç
